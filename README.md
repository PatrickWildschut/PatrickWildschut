Hi all, I'm Patrick Wildschut from the Netherlands and I like to code and h4ck.

------------------------------------------------------------------

# My History
I started to code when I was 14 years old and hacking when I was 17 years old.

# This GitHub
This GitHub has a lot of `Private/Hidden Repositories` because I don't want people to steal my code or just spy on me L0L. The repositories that are `Public` usually contain scripts and tools that I don't really care about.
