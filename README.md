Hi all, I'm Patrick Wildschut from the Netherlands and I like to code and h4ck. Right now, I'm still in highschool (5 Havo) and after that I will study to become a `Software Developer`. But I'm sure I want to do something with `H4CK1NG` later in my life aswell, so I will 'probably' try to get some h4ck3r certificates after I'm done studying Software Developing.

I see myself as a beginner in both coding and hacking :D (although people say I'm not)

# My History
I started to code when I was 14 years old and hacking when I was 17 years old.

# This GitHub
This GitHub has a lot of `Private/Hidden Repositories` because I don't want people to steal my code or just spy on me L0L. The repositories that are `Public` usually contain scripts and tools that I don't really care about.
