Hi all, I'm Patrick Wildschut from the Netherlands and I like to code and hack.

------------------------------------------------------------------

# My History
I started to code when I was 14 years old and hacking when I was 17 years old. Throughout the years I've gained valuable skills to make nice projects.

# This GitHub
This GitHub has a lot of `Private/Hidden Repositories` because of unfinished projects. The repositories that are `Public` are the projects that I am proud of and I want to share with the world!
